# DESTINY Search Space

This repository contains a preliminary analysis of DESTINY input parameters. It includes the `row_cols_subarray_destiny.py` file, which performs the analysis, and the `DESTINY_search_space.py` and `DESTINY_search_space.m` files, which implement the search algorithm for generating possible values of input capacity (MB) and possible mat organization inside a single bank.

## Requirements

To run the Python code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- numpy
